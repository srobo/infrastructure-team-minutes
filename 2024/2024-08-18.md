# Infrastructure Team Meeting 2024-08-18

## Present

- Karina Kwiatek
- Peter Law

### Apologies

- Andy Barrett-Sprot


## Topics

### CRM

- Next steps here are to poke HubSpot to ensure the free plan is workable for us in terms of features and that we can handle multiple years’ teams in it in a sensible way. From our previous poking it seemed a bit fiddly.
- Have added Karina to HubSpot as she’s the Teams Area Owner for SR2025

### Funding – Mythic Beasts’ sponsorship

- They’d agreed three years worth of sponsorship, we should reach out to them and see if they’d be happy to continue this
- If not, we’ll need to look at alternatives promptly
- Action: Peter speak to the fundraising team about Mythic, potentially contact Mythic

## Action Points
