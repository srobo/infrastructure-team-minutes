### CRM for Teams

- We have 15 hours of time from a sponsor, is asking them to help spec it out worth exploring?
- We should think about this in terms of loan systems rather than sales systems
- ERPNext might be an option
- Maybe something custom built on Django? Wagtail may have some CRMish things?
