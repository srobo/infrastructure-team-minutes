# Infrastructure Team Meeting 2023-03-15

## Attendees

- Jake Howard
- James Seden Smith
- Peter Law

## Topics

### Documentation platform exploration

- No update (don’t have time until after the competition)

### CRM platform exploration

- No update (don’t have time until after the competition)

### Saturday doing slot

- Let’s drop the Saturday Doing slot, it’s not working
- Maybe Doing in the alternate slots when we’re not Meeting, perhaps every 2 weeks?
- Benefit of Doings are two-fold:
  - Lots of people working together, hence short review cycle times
  - Having enough dedicated time to get things done (the current slot in theory means we have a whole afternoon)
- Conclusion: drop the slot, encourage more self organisation

### How can we progress things more

- What can we do to help progress things more?
- Maybe move the meeting to a different evening, follow it up with a Doing (as the competition team meetings do)?
- Currently actions are competing with other SR commitments (e.g: the competition)
- Low frequency of meetings makes it easy to forget the actions
  - Peter prodded in Slack in the middle week, this wasn’t enough on its own to help (but might be more useful once we have more spare time)
- Let’s not worry about this for now, regroup after the competition and see if we can plan to do more in the cycle after that

### On-call support at the competition

- Haven’t heard anything specific yet, but as we’re all also going to be in the competition meeting this evening we can pick it up then.
