## Attendees

## Topics

### Meeting timings

- Is this still a good timeslot?
  - We’ve had a few meetings with very low attendance
  - This is still a good slot, there have just been other things happening
    - It would have been good to have had people say that they couldn’t make it to the meetings

- Would it make sense for the committee to meet separately to plan things
  - Let’s try this
  - 7pm on the Monday before the team meeting

### SR2023 Competition

- Update regarding the website for between the virtual competition and the competition
  - ASAP after the second challenge deadline until the virtual competition:
    - Competition pages live
    - the `latest-content` bar will also link to the competition pages

  - During the virtual competition:
    - Competition mode

  - After the virtual competition:
    - the `latest-content` bar will also link to the competition pages
    - Interim competition mode – add the leaderboard to the homepage

  - During the competition:
    - Competition mode

  - After the competition:
    - the `latest-content` bar will also link to the competition pages, until the compbox is dropped

- What SRComp/competition-website changes are needed?
  - Mechanism to represent the challenge points
  - Happy for this to just be extra baseline points
  - Stretch goal: have something which shows the challenges & their points, maybe even links to their videos etc.
  - Maybe have some wording on the league table page which acknowledges the challenges

- What infrastructure does the virtual competition need?
  - Compstate repo
  - Compbox, for the livestream
  - Code Submitter
  - Website in competition mode
  - Mechanism to switch to the interim competition mode

- What infrastructure does the competition need?
  - Virtual competition plus the in-venue stuff, nothing extra from this team

### Competitor Services

- Ansible for the competitor services VM
  - Baseline is now live & running
  - The Discord bot is running but not ansibled
  - Competition team have asked for the code submitter
    - Use the same credentials as the discord bot

### Calendar

- The all-committees meeting would like us to enumerate timings of key things in the SR year
- Request that the competition team include the dates they want the compbox live?
- Primarily this team will be a consumer of the information in the calendar
- Our dates:
  - Review date for the third party access continuity sheet
    - There had been discussions about moving this to 6 monthly reviews
  - Renewal dates for various accounts
    - E.g: web domains need repurchasing
  - Suggestion:
    - Include credit card expiry dates
    - Include team budget deadlines

### CRMs

- We would like:
  - CRM for Teams
  - CRM for Volunteers(?)

- There’s a Slack thread which has started collecting some ideas
- Do we have a preference around hosting (self/third party) and cost?
  - The will be a limit to cost (obviously), but don’t feel it needs to be free
    - Can we get a charity discount or a sponsor
  - Start with features and then see which are in budget
  - Asking Mythic to host a “self hosted” instance is in theory viable

### Docs

- Gathering requirements for a common documentation platform
- At this stage this is about talking to other teams and finding out what’s important to them

### External Communications

- We’ve started planning the infrastructure for the competition
- We’ve started investigating a CRM for teams & volunteers
- We’ve started collecting information from internal teams about iterating our internal documentation platform
