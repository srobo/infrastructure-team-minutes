# Infrastructure Team Meeting 2023-11-20

## Attendees

* Andy Barrett-Sprot
* Karina Kwiatek
* Peter Law

## Topics

### CRM update

* Peter had a play with ERPNext and Odoo, neither seemed immediately great as there was a lot of setup needed. See more details in the [Slack thread](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C2XEPED0D/p1698088632037159?thread_ts=1686003286.991619\&cid=C2XEPED0D). Still need to look into OSTickets.
* Andy is still to investigate Hubspot further to confirm if we can use the free plan.

### Docs platform update

* No update from Jake

### Email infra update

* DMARC policy set up, still in “testing” mode, seems to maybe being having some positive impact

  * Using EasyDMARC to monitor DMARC and the like

  * Reporting set up:

    * <https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/studentrobotics.org/g/dmarc-aggregate-reports>
    * <https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/studentrobotics.org/g/dmarc-forensic-reports>

* STS policy set up, also in “testing” mode, no reports of non-secure email as yet; reports to <https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/studentrobotics.org/g/smtp-tls-reports>

* Have investigated [BIMI](https://bimigroup.org/), which offers branding of the image sender in some clients, this seems to cost a lot for background checks and digital signatures (and needs DMARC on its strictest mode etc.); likely out of reach for us as a charity for now.

* Started collecting an understanding of email addresses are used publicly, so we can get a clearer idea of how they’re used.

* No current plans to add more stuff here, monitoring DMARC etc. will continue in the background. At some point we might want to move to a stricter DMARC policy (i.e: quarantine)

### Access continuity

* Have sent an email reminder to all the committees to review & update the access continuity spreadsheet.
