### Celebration

- we shipped a competition :)

### Things from the all committees meeting

- We should explore “shared inbox” style lists and help other teams work out if these would be useful to them

### Documentation Platform update (Jake)

- Some research has been started
- Aiming to get an email out to teams to solicit requirements soon™

### CRM update (James)

- Odoo (an open source ERP & CRM) has been suggested by other volunteers, we’ll have a play with that

  - Will have a play with that
  - Available hosted or self-hosted, the hosted version is > $10/month
  - Can we get Mythic to sort it out for us?

- Timeboxed experiment of one year was suggested, this seems like a good idea, makes it easier to throw away at the end

### Container hosting

- Jake has been exploring options in this space
- Much debate was had about the approach and whether building a thing ourselves is even useful (vs using Kubernetes or even just using services like fly.io)
- We should explore how much we can we hand off to Mythic before trying to create too much of our own solution
