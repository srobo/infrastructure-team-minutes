# Infrastructure Team Minutes

Minutes from the [Infrastructure Team][infrastructure-team] meetings.

The canonical instance of this repository is on github at
https://github.com/srobo/infrastructure-team-minutes.

## Agenda

The agenda doc lives in Google Drive, and is linked from meeting events'
calendar entries.

To aid with converting the Google doc into markdown, it's recommended to use
[this tool](https://github.com/Mr0grog/google-docs-to-markdown).

## Actions script

Actions from each meeting are recorded as [issues][github-issues] on the github
instance. There is a Python script to support this:
```
./scripts/create-actions.py 2018/2018-11-21.md
```
The script requires Python 3.6+ and the [requests][python-requests] library. It
uses the [GitHub REST API v3][github-rest-api], for which you should create a
[Personal Access Token][api-tokens] with scope `repo:public_repo`.
