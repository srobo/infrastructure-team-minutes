### Automated setup of DIscord via the Discord bot

Karina has been exploring this.
It's going well, looks like we can automate a lot of stuff.
Setup of a new server for an SR year is essentially fully automated.

Some stuff we might want to keep as manually run, but can turn into one click actions.

Discord offers good support for interactive prompts back & forth with the bot, which offers a lot of freedom.
An example might be making the server read-only at the end of the year, where the bot could check whether you have or want to post a final message, help post that message and then mark the server read-only (plus change the icon etc.) all from a single initial command.
